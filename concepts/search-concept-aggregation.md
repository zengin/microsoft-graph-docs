# Refine search results using aggregations (preview)

Refine search results and show their distribution in the index.

## Example 1: Request aggregations by string fields

The following example searches **listItem** resources and aggregates results by their file type and content class, both of which are string values.

The response includes two [searchBucket](/graph/api/resources/searchbucket?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) objects for the two aggregations:
- The **key** property specifies the actual value (by `FileType` or `contentclass`) for those matching **listItem** objects that are aggregated in the same bucket by that value.
- The **count** property specifies the number of such objects aggregated in the same bucket. Note that this number is an approximation of the number of matches and will not provide an exact number of matches.
- Buckets of results aggregated by file type are sorted by count in descending order. In this example, there are 3 buckets for 3 file types: `docx`, `xlsx`, and `pptx`.
- Buckets of results aggregated by content class are sorted by the string value of the content class in descending order. In this example, there is only one bucket with all the matching objects sharing the same content class, `STS_ListItem_DocumentLibrary`.

## Example 2: Apply an aggregation filter based on a previous request

In this example, we apply an aggregation filter that is based on the **aggregationFilterToken** returned for `docx` as the `FileType` field in example 1.

The string value assigned to the **aggregationFilters** property follows the format **"{field}:\\"{aggregationFilterToken}\\""**. If multiple values for the same filter are required, the string value assigned to the **aggregationFilters** property should follow this format : **"{field}:or(\\"{aggregationFilterToken1}\\",\\"{aggregationFilterToken2}\\")"**.

## Example 3: Request aggregation by a numeric field

The following example searches **driveItem** resources and aggregates results by their size which is a numeric value. The request specifies aggregation by 3 size ranges:
- Size less than 100
- Size between 100 and 1000
- Size 1000 and higher

The response includes 3 **searchBucket** objects, one for each size range aggregation:
- The 2 buckets of the lower size ranges don't include any search matches.
- All 9 search matches have sizes 1000 or higher.

## Known limitations

Aggregations are supported only for SharePoint or OneDrive items. They are not supported for **message** or **event**.
