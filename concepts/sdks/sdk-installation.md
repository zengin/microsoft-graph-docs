# Install the Microsoft Graph SDKs

The Microsoft Graph SDKs are available to be included in your projects via GitHub and popular platform package managers. This topic describes how you can install the Microsoft Graph SDK into your project.

## Install the Microsoft Graph .NET SDK

The Microsoft Graph .NET SDK is included in the following NuGet packages:

- [Microsoft.Graph](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-dotnet) - Contains the models and request builders for accessing the `v1.0` endpoint with the fluent API. Microsoft.Graph has a dependency on Microsoft.Graph.Core.
- [Microsoft.Graph.Beta](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-beta-sdk-dotnet) - Contains the models and request builders for accessing the `beta` endpoint with the fluent API. Microsoft.Graph.Beta has a dependency on Microsoft.Graph.Core.
- [Microsoft.Graph.Core](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-dotnet) - The core library for making calls to Microsoft Graph.
- [Microsoft.Graph.Auth](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-dotnet-auth) - Provides an authentication scenario-based wrapper of the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for use with the Microsoft Graph SDK. Microsoft.Graph.Auth has a dependency on Microsoft.Graph.Core.

You can use either the [Package Manager UI in Visual Studio or the Package Manager Console](/nuget/quickstart/install-and-use-a-package-in-visual-studio) to install the Microsoft.Graph packages into your project. The following Package Manager Console commands will install the Microsoft.Graph, Microsoft.Graph.Core, and Microsoft.Graph.Auth libraries. Microsoft.Graph.Core is installed as a dependency of Microsoft.Graph.

```PowerShell
Install-Package Microsoft.Graph
Install-Package Microsoft.Graph.Auth -IncludePrerelease
```

## Install the Microsoft Graph Java SDK

- [microsoft-graph-beta](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-beta-sdk-java) - Contains the models and request builders for accessing the `beta` endpoint with the fluent API.
- [microsoft-graph-core](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-java-core) - The core library for making calls to Microsoft Graph.
- [microsoft-graph-auth](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-java-auth) - Provides an authentication scenario-based wrapper of Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for use with the Microsoft Graph SDK.

### Install the Microsoft Graph Java SDK via Gradle

Add the repository and a compile dependency for microsoft-graph to your project's build.gradle:

```Gradle
repository {
    jcenter()
    jcenter{
        url 'https://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local'
    }
}

dependency {
    // Include the sdk as a dependency
    implementation 'com.microsoft.graph:microsoft-graph:2.+'
    implementation 'com.microsoft.graph:microsoft-graph-auth:0.3.0'
}
```

### Install the Microsoft Graph Java SDK via Maven

Add the repositories in the `profiles` element in pom.xml:

```xml
<profiles>
    <profile>
        <repositories>
            <repository>
                <snapshots>
                    <enabled>false</enabled>
                </snapshots>
                <id>bintray-microsoftgraph-Maven</id>
                <name>bintray</name>
                <url>https://dl.bintray.com/microsoftgraph/Maven</url>
            </repository>
        </repositories>
    </profile>
    <profile>
       <id>allow-snapshots</id>
          <activation><activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault></activation>
       <repositories>
         <repository>
           <id>snapshots-repo</id>
           <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
           <releases><enabled>false</enabled></releases>
           <snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
         </repository>
       </repositories>
     </profile>
</profiles>
```

Add the dependency in the `dependencies` element in pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.microsoft.graph</groupId>
    <artifactId>microsoft-graph</artifactId>
    <version>[2.0,)</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.microsoft.graph</groupId>
    <artifactId>microsoft-graph-auth</artifactId>
    <version>0.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Install the Microsoft Graph Javascript SDK

The Microsoft Graph Javascript SDK is included in the following packages:

- @microsoft/microsoft-graph-client ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client))- The core library for making calls to Microsoft Graph.
- @microsoft/microsoft-graph-types ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/microsoft-graph-types)) - The Typescript types for the Microsoft Graph entities.

You can use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) to install the Microsoft Graph Javascript SDK:

```Shell
npm install @microsoft/microsoft-graph-client --save
npm install @microsoft/microsoft-graph-types --save-dev
```

## Install the Microsoft Graph Objective-C SDK

The Microsoft Graph Objective-C SDK supports both iOS and macOS platforms and can be installed into your project using either CocoaPods or Carthage.

### Install the Microsoft Graph Objective-C SDK using Cocoapods

Add the following line in your podfile to include the Objective-C Microsoft Graph SDK and Microsoft Graph Objective-C Auth SDK in your xcode project:

```ruby
pod 'MSGraphClientSDK'
pod 'MSGraphMSALAuthProvider'
```

### Install the Microsoft Graph Objective-C SDK using Carthage

Perform the following steps to install the Microsoft Graph Objective-C SDK and Microsoft Graph Objective-C Auth SDK using the [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) package manager.

1. Create a **Cartfile** that specifies the Objective-C SDK GitHub repository and [release tag](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-objc/releases) to target.

    ```text
    github "microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-objc" "tags/<latest_release_tag>"
    github "microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-objc-auth" "tags/<latest_release_tag>"
    ```

1. Run `carthage update`. This will fetch dependencies into a Carthage/Checkouts folder and then builds the MSGraphClientSDK library.

1. Using Xcode, in your application target's **General** settings tab, in the **Linked Frameworks and Libraries** section, drag and drop the **MSGraphClientSDK.framework** and **MSGraphMSALAuthProvider.framework** from the Carthage/Build folder on disk.

1. On your application target's **Build Phases** settings tab, click the **+** icon and choose **New Run Script Phase**. Create a run script in which you specify your shell (ex: /bin/sh), and add the following contents to the script:

    ```Shell
    /usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks
    ```

1. Add the paths to the frameworks you want to use under **Input Files**.

    ```Shell
    $(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/MSGraphClientSDK.framework
    $(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/MSGraphMSALAuthProvider.framework
    ```

## Install the Microsoft Graph PHP SDK

The [Microsoft Graph PHP SDK](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-php) is available from [packagist.org](https://packagist.org/packages/microsoft/microsoft-graph) and can be installed in the following ways:

### Install the Microsoft Graph PHP SDK manually using composer

```Shell
composer require microsoft/microsoft-graph
```

### Install the Microsoft Graph PHP SDK using composer.json

```json
{
    "require": {
        "microsoft/microsoft-graph": "^1.8"
    }
}
```

## Install the Microsoft PowerShell SDK

See [Install the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK](../powershell/installation.md).

## Install the Microsoft Graph Ruby SDK

The [Microsoft Graph Ruby SDK](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-ruby) is available from [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/) and can be installed using the following command:

```ruby
gem install microsoft_graph
```
