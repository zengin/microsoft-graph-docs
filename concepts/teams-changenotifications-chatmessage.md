# Get change notifications for messages in Teams channels and chats using Microsoft Graph

Change notifications enable you to subscribe to changes (create, update, and delete) to [messages](/graph/api/resources/chatMessage?preserve-view=true) in a [channel](/graph/api/resources/channel?preserve-view=true) or [chat](/graph/api/resources/chat?preserve-view=true). Change notifications provide a low latency model by allowing you to maintain a [subscription](/graph/api/resources/webhooks?preserve-view=true). You can also get the resource data in the notifications and therefore avoid calling the API to get the payload.

>**Note:** The maximum time a subscription can last is 60 minutes; however, subscriptions can be renewed until the caller has permissions to access to resource.

## Subscribe to changes at the tenant level

To track all changes related to messages in a tenant, you can use subscriptions at a tenant level for channel and chat messages. This requires you to create two subscriptions: one to track all messages across [channels](/graph/api/resources/channel?preserve-view=true), and one to track all messages across [chats](/graph/api/resources/chat?preserve-view=true).

### Subscribe to messages across channels

To get to change notifications for all messages and replies across channels in a tenant, subscribe to `/teams/getAllMessages`. This resource supports [including resource data](webhooks-with-resource-data.md) in the notification.

#### Permissions

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Not supported. |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | ChannelMessage.Read.All |

#### Example

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "changeType": "created,updated",
  "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.azurewebsites.net/api/resourceNotifications",
  "resource": "/teams/getAllMessages",
  "includeResourceData": true,
  "encryptionCertificate": "{base64encodedCertificate}",
  "encryptionCertificateId": "{customId}",
  "expirationDateTime": "2019-09-19T11:00:00.0000000Z",
  "clientState": "{secretClientState}"
}
```

### Subscribe to messages across chats

To get change notifications for all messages across chats in a tenant, subscribe to `/chats/getAllMessages`. This resource supports [including resource data](webhooks-with-resource-data.md) in the notification.

#### Permissions

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Not supported. |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Chat.Read.All |

#### Example

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "changeType": "created,updated,deleted",
  "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.azurewebsites.net/api/resourceNotifications",
  "resource": "/chats/getAllMessages",
  "includeResourceData": true,
  "encryptionCertificate": "{base64encodedCertificate}",
  "encryptionCertificateId": "{customId}",
  "expirationDateTime": "2019-09-19T11:00:00.0000000Z",
  "clientState": "{secretClientState}"
}
```

## Subscribe to messages in a channel

To track messages and replies in a channel, you can create a change notification subscription at a channel level. To do this, subscribe to `/teams{id}/channels/{id}/messages`. This resource supports [including resource data](webhooks-with-resource-data.md) in the notification in *application-only mode*.

Channel-level subscriptions also support keyword-based search via the `$search` query parameter.

### Permissions

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | ChannelMessage.Read.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | ChannelMessage.Read.All, ChannelMessage.Read.Group* |

>**Note:** ChannelMessage.Read.Group is supported as part of [resource-specific consent](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent).

### Example 1: Subscribe to all messages (and replies) in a channel

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "changeType": "created,updated",
  "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.azurewebsites.net/api/resourceNotifications",
  "resource": "/teams/{id}/channels/{id}/messages",
  "includeResourceData": true,
  "encryptionCertificate": "{base64encodedCertificate}",
  "encryptionCertificateId": "{customId}",
  "expirationDateTime": "2019-09-19T11:00:00.0000000Z",
  "clientState": "{secretClientState}"
}
```

### Example 2: Subscribe to messages (and replies) in a channel that contain certain text

The following request will send messages that contain `Hello` to the subscriber.

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "changeType": "created,updated",
  "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.azurewebsites.net/api/resourceNotifications",
  "resource": "/teams/{id}/channels/{id}/messages?$search=Hello",
  "includeResourceData": true,
  "encryptionCertificate": "{base64encodedCertificate}",
  "encryptionCertificateId": "{customId}",
  "expirationDateTime": "2019-09-19T11:00:00.0000000Z",
  "clientState": "{secretClientState}"
}
```

### Example 3: Subscribe to messages (and replies) in a channel without resource data

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "changeType": "created,updated",
  "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.azurewebsites.net/api/resourceNotifications",
  "resource": "/teams/{id}/channels/{id}/messages",
  "includeResourceData": false,
  "expirationDateTime": "2019-09-19T11:00:00.0000000Z",
  "clientState": "{secretClientState}"
}
```

### Example 4: Subscribe to messages (and replies) in a channel that mention a specific user

To get notifications only for messages where a specific user has been mentioned, you can specify the user's ID (`9a6eb4d1-826b-48b1-9627-b50836c8fee9` in this example) in the query.

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "changeType": "created,updated",
  "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.azurewebsites.net/api/resourceNotifications",
  "resource": "/teams/{id}/channels/{id}/messages?$filter=mentions/any(u: u/mentioned/user/id eq '9a6eb4d1-826b-48b1-9627-b50836c8fee9')",
  "includeResourceData": false,
  "expirationDateTime": "2019-09-19T11:00:00.0000000Z",
  "clientState": "{secretClientState}"
}
```

## Subscribe to messages in a chat

To track messages in a chat, you can create a change notification subscription at a chat level. To do this, subscribe to `/chats{id}/messages`. This resource supports [including resource data](webhooks-with-resource-data.md) in the notification in *application-only mode*.

Chat-level subscriptions also support keyword-based search via the `$search` query parameter.

> **Note.** Subcribing to messages in a chat is currently in preview.

  "includeResourceData": false,
  "expirationDateTime": "2019-09-19T11:00:00.0000000Z",
  "clientState": "{secretClientState}"
}
```

## Notification payloads

Depending on your subscription, you can either get the notification with resource data, or without it. Subscribing with resource data allows you to get the message payload along with the notification, removing the need to call back and get the content.

### Notifications with resource data

For notifications with resource data, the payload looks like the following. This payload is for a message sent in a chat.

```json
{
    "value": [{
        "subscriptionId": "10493aa0-4d29-4df5-bc0c-ef742cc6cd7f",
        "changeType": "created",
        "clientState": "<<--SpecifiedClientState-->>",
        "subscriptionExpirationDateTime": "2021-02-02T10:30:34.9097561-08:00",
        "resource": "chats('19:8ea0e38b-efb3-4757-924a-5f94061cf8c2_97f62344-57dc-409c-88ad-c4af14158ff5@unq.gbl.spaces')/messages('1612289765949')",
        "resourceData": {
            "id": "1612289765949",
            "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Graph.chatMessage",
            "@odata.id": "chats('19:8ea0e38b-efb3-4757-924a-5f94061cf8c2_97f62344-57dc-409c-88ad-c4af14158ff5@unq.gbl.spaces')/messages('1612289765949')"
        },
        "encryptedContent": {
            "data": "<<--EncryptedContent-->",
            "dataKey": "<<--EnryptedDataKeyUsedForEncryptingContent-->>",
            "encryptionCertificateId": "<<--IdOfTheCertificateUsedForEncryptingDataKey-->>",
            "encryptionCertificateThumbprint": "<<--ThumbprintOfTheCertificateUsedForEncryptingDataKey-->>"
        },
        "tenantId": "<<--TenantForWhichNotificationWasSent-->>"
    }],
    "validationTokens": ["<<--ValidationTokens-->>"]
}
```

For details about how to validate tokens and decrypt the payload, see [Set up change notifications that include resource data](webhooks-with-resource-data.md).

The decrypted notification payload looks like the following. The payload conforms to the [chatMessage](/graph/api/resources/chatMessage?preserve-view=true) schema. The payload is similar to that returned by GET operations.

```json
{
  "id": "1612289992105",
  "replyToId": null,
  "etag": "1612289992105",
  "messageType": "message",
  "createdDateTime": "2021-02-02T18:19:52Z",
  "lastModifiedDateTime": "2021-02-02T18:19:52.105Z",
  "lastEditedDateTime": null,
  "deletedDateTime": null,
  "subject": null,
  "summary": null,
  "chatId": "19:8ea0e38b-efb3-4757-924a-5f94061cf8c2_97f62344-57dc-409c-88ad-c4af14158ff5@unq.gbl.spaces",
  "importance": "normal",
  "locale": "en-us",
  "webUrl": null,
  "from": {
    "application": null,
    "device": null,
    "user": {
      "id": "8ea0e38b-efb3-4757-924a-5f94061cf8c2",
      "displayName": "Ramjot Singh",
      "userIdentityType": "aadUser"
    },
    "conversation": null
  },
  "body": {
    "contentType": "text",
    "content": "test"
  },
  "channelIdentity": null,
  "attachments": [],
  "mentions": [],
  "policyViolation": null,
  "reactions": [],
  "replies": [],
  "hostedContents": []
}
```

### Notifications without resource data

Notifications without resource data give you enough information to make GET calls to get the message content. Subscriptions for notifications without resource data do not require an encryption certificate (because actual resource data is not sent over).

The payload looks like the following. This payload is for a message sent in a channel.

```json
 {
  "subscriptionId": "9f9d1ed0-c9cc-42e7-8d80-a7fc4b0cda3c",
  "changeType": "created",
  "tenantId": "<<--TenantForWhichNotificationWasSent-->>",
  "clientState": "<<--SpecifiedClientState-->>",
  "subscriptionExpirationDateTime": "2021-02-02T11:26:41.0537895-08:00",
  "resource": "teams('fbe2bf47-16c8-47cf-b4a5-4b9b187c508b')/channels('19:4a95f7d8db4c4e7fae857bcebe0623e6@thread.tacv2')/messages('1612293113399')",
  "resourceData": {
    "id": "1612293113399",
    "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Graph.chatMessage",
    "@odata.id": "teams('fbe2bf47-16c8-47cf-b4a5-4b9b187c508b')/channels('19:4a95f7d8db4c4e7fae857bcebe0623e6@thread.tacv2')/messages('1612293113399')"
  }
}
```

The **resource** and **@odata.id** properties can be used to make calls to Microsoft Graph to get the payload for the message. GET calls will always return the current state of the message. If the message is changed between when the notification is sent and when the message is retrieved, the operation will return the updated message.
