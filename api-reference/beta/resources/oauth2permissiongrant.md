# oAuth2PermissionGrant resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents the delegated permissions that have been granted to an application's service principal.

Delegated permissions grants can be created as a result of a user consenting the an application's request to access an API, or created directly.

Delegated permissions are sometimes referred to as "OAuth 2.0 scopes" or "scopes".

## Methods

| Method | Return Type | Description |
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| [List oAuth2PermissionGrants](../api/oauth2permissiongrant-list.md) | [oAuth2PermissionGrant](oauth2permissiongrant.md) collection | Retrieve a list of delegated permission grants. |
| [Get oAuth2PermissionGrant](../api/oauth2permissiongrant-get.md) | [oAuth2PermissionGrant](oauth2permissiongrant.md)  | Read a single delegated permission grant.|
| [Create oAuth2PermissionGrant](../api/oauth2permissiongrant-post.md) | [oAuth2PermissionGrant](oauth2permissiongrant.md) | Create a delegated permission grant. |
| [Update oAuth2PermissionGrant](../api/oauth2permissiongrant-update.md) | None | Update oAuth2PermissionGrant object. |
| [Delete oAuth2PermissionGrant](../api/oauth2permissiongrant-delete.md) | None  | Delete a delegated permission grant. |

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| id | String | Unique identifier for the **oAuth2PermissionGrant**. Read-only.|
| clientId | String | The **id** of the client [service principal](serviceprincipal.md) for the application which is authorized to act on behalf of a signed-in user when accessing an API. Required. Supports `$filter` (`eq` only). |
| consentType | String | Indicates if authorization is granted for the client application to impersonate all users or only a specific user. *AllPrincipals* indicates authorization to impersonate all users. *Principal* indicates authorization to impersonate a specific user. Consent on behalf of all users can be granted by an administrator. Non-admin users may be authorized to consent on behalf of themselves in some cases, for some delegated permissions. Required. Supports `$filter` (`eq` only). |
| principalId | String | The **id** of the [user](user.md) on behalf of whom the client is authorized to access the resource, when **consentType** is *Principal*. If **consentType** is *AllPrincipals* this value is null. Required when **consentType** is *Principal*. |
| resourceId | String | The **id** of the resource [service principal](serviceprincipal.md) to which access is authorized. This identifies the API which the client is authorized to attempt to call on behalf of a signed-in user. |
| scope | String | A space-separated list of the claim values for delegated permissions which should be included in access tokens for the resource application (the API). For example, `openid User.Read GroupMember.Read.All`. Each claim value should match the **value** field of one of the delegated permissions defined by the API, listed in the **publishedPermissionScopes** property of the resource [service principal](serviceprincipal.md). |
| startTime | DateTimeOffset | Currently, the start time value is ignored, but a value is required when creating an **oAuth2PermissionGrant**. Required. |
| expiryTime | DateTimeOffset | Currently, the end time value is ignored, but a value is required when creating an **oAuth2PermissionGrant**. Required. |

## Relationships

This resource supports using [delta query](/graph/delta-query-overview) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates, by providing a [delta](../api/oauth2permissiongrant-delta.md) function.

|[Get oAuth2PermissionGrant](../api/oauth2permissiongrant-get.md) | [oAuth2PermissionGrant](oauth2permissiongrant.md) |Read the properties and relationships of an **oAuth2PermissionGrant** object.|
|[Update oAuth2PermissionGrant](../api/oauth2permissiongrant-update.md) | [oAuth2PermissionGrant](oauth2permissiongrant.md)	|Update an  **oAuth2PermissionGrant** object. |
|[Delete oAuth2PermissionGrant](../api/oauth2permissiongrant-delete.md) | None |Delete an **oAuth2PermissionGrant** object. |
|[Get delta](../api/oauth2permissiongrant-delta.md)|[oAuth2PermissionGrant](oauth2permissiongrant.md)|Get newly created, updated, or deleted **oauth2permissiongrant** objects without performing a full read of the entire resource collection.|

## Properties
| Property	   | Type	|Description|
