# user resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents an Azure AD user account. Inherits from [directoryObject](directoryobject.md).

The **user** resource let apps specify user preferences for languages, and date/time formats for the user's primary Exchange mailboxes, and for the user's Azure AD profile. For more details, see [user preferences for languages and regional formats](#user-preferences-for-languages-and-regional-formats).

For performance reasons, the [create](../api/user-post-users.md), [get](../api/user-get.md), and [list](../api/user-list.md) operations return only a subset of more commonly used properties by default. These default properties are noted in the [Properties](#properties) section. To get any of the properties that are not returned by default, specify them in a `$select` OData query option.

This resource supports:

- Adding your own data to custom properties as [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview).
- Subscribing to [change notifications](/graph/webhooks).
- Using [delta query](/graph/delta-query-overview) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates, by providing a [delta](../api/user-delta.md) function.

### Legal age group property definitions

This section explains how the three age group properties (**legalAgeGroupClassification**, **ageGroup** and **consentProvidedForMinor**) are used by Azure AD administrators and enterprise application developers to meet age-related regulations:
- The **legalAgeGroupClassification** property is read-only. It is used by enterprise application developers to ensure the correct handling of a user based on their legal age group. It is calculated based on the user's **ageGroup** and **consentProvidedForMinor** properties.
- **ageGroup** and **consentProvidedForMinor** are optional properties used by Azure AD administrators to help ensure the use of an account is handled correctly based on the age-related regulatory rules governing the user's country or region.

For example: Cameron is administrator of a directory for an elementary school in Holyport in the United Kingdom. At the beginning of the school year he uses the admissions paperwork to obtain consent from the minor's parents based on the age-related regulations of the United Kingdom. The consent obtained from the parent allows the minor's account to be used by Holyport school and Microsoft apps. Cameron then creates all the accounts and sets ageGroup to "minor" and consentProvidedForMinor to "granted". Applications used by his students are then able to suppress features that are not suitable for minors.
<!-- Note that the following 3 sub-sections are only documented like enums for a consistent user experience. 
For some reason they are not defined as enums in the CSDL. 
Hence the type of the corresponding 3 properties remain as string type in the Properties table.
-->

#### legalAgeGroupClassification values

| Member    | Description|

|null|Default value, no **ageGroup** has been set for the user.|

### User preferences for languages and regional formats
The **user** resource contains a [mailboxSettings](../resources/mailboxsettings.md) property which includes the user's preferred language, date and time formatting, default time zone, and other settings specifically for their primary Exchange mailbox. These preferences are targeted for mail clients and are only available if the user has a mailbox provisioned. You can choose to use **mailboxSettings** if your scenario focuses only on Outlook mail, calendar, contacts, or to-do tasks.

In addition to **mailboxSettings**, **user** includes a relationship via [userSettings](../resources/usersettings.md) to [regionalAndLanguageSettings](../resources/regionalandlanguagesettings.md), the superset of language and regional formatting preferences that can be used by any application to provide the user with the best language and regional formatting experience. Use **userSettings** for a consistent experience across apps that tap into the Azure AD user profile to reflect the same user preferences.
