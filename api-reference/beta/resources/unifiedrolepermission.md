# unifiedRolePermission resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents a collection of allowed resource actions and the conditions that must be met for the action to be effective. Resource actions are tasks that can be perfomed on a resource. For example, the application resource supports create, update, delete, and reset password resource actions.

## Properties

| Property     | Type        | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------|
|allowedResourceActions|String collection| Set of tasks that can be performed on a resource. |
|condition|String| Optional constraints that must be met for the permission to be effective. |

### allowedResourceActions property

The following is the schema for resource actions: 

```
<Namespace>/<Entity>/<PropertySet>/<Action>  
```
For example: `microsoft.directory/applications/credentials/update`.  

- Namespace - The services that exposes the task. For example, all tasks in Azure Active Directory use the namespace microsoft.directory.  
- Entity - The logical features or components exposed by the service in Microsoft Graph. For example, applications, service principals, or groups.
- PropertySet - The specific properties or aspects of the entity for which access is being granted. For example, 
`microsoft.directory/applications/authentication/read` grants the ability to read the reply URL, logout URL, and implicit flow property on the **application** object in Azure AD. The following are reserved names for common property sets:  
  - allProperties - Designates all properties of the entity, including privileged properties. Examples include `microsoft.directory/applications/allProperties/read` and `microsoft.directory/applications/allProperties/update`.
  - basic - Designates common read properties but excludes privileged ones. For example, `microsoft.directory/applications/basic/update` includes the ability to update standard properties like display name.
  - standard - Designates common update properties but excludes privileged ones. For example, `microsoft.directory/applications/standard/read`.
- Actions - The operations being granted. In most circumstances, permissions should be expressed in terms of CRUD or allTasks. Actions include:
  - Create - The ability to create a new instance of the entity.
  - Read - The ability to read a given property set (including allProperties).
  - Update - The ability to update a given property set (including allProperties).
  - Delete - The ability to delete a given entity.
  - AllTasks - Represents all CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete). 

### condition property
Conditions define constraints that must be met. For example, a requirement that the principal be an "owner" of the target. The following are the supported conditions:

- Self: "$ResourceIsSelf"
- Owner: "$SubjectIsOwner"

The following is an example of a role permission with a condition.

```json
"rolePermissions": [
        {
            "allowedResourceActions": [
                "microsoft.directory/applications/basic/update",
                "microsoft.directory/applications/credentials/update"
            ],
            "condition":  "$SubjectIsOwner"
        }
    ]

```
