# accessReviewScheduleDefinition resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE [accessreviews-disclaimer-v2](../../includes/accessreviews-disclaimer-v2.md)]

Represents the scheduling of an Azure AD [access review](accessreviewsv2-root.md). 

An accessReviewScheduleDefinition contains a list of [accessReviewInstance](accessreviewinstance.md) objects. Each recurrence of the schedule definition will create an instance. Instances also represent each unique group being reviewed. If a schedule definition reviews multiple groups, each group will have a unique instance per each recurrence. In the case of a one-time review, only one instance will be created per group.

|[Create accessReviewScheduleDefinition](../api/accessreviewscheduledefinition-create.md) | [accessReviewScheduleDefinition](accessreviewscheduledefinition.md) | Create a new accessReviewScheduleDefinition. |
|[Delete accessReviewScheduleDefinition](../api/accessreviewscheduledefinition-delete.md) | None. | Delete an accessReviewScheduleDefinition with a specified identifier. |

| scope  |[accessReviewScope](../resources/accessreviewscope.md)  | Defines scope of users reviewed. For supported scopes, see [accessReviewScope](accessreviewscope.md). Required on create. |
| instanceEnumerationScope|[accessReviewScope](../resources/accessreviewscope.md)  | In the case of a review of guest users across all Microsoft 365 groups, this determines the scope of which groups will be reviewed. Each group will become a unique accessReviewInstance of the access review series.  For supported scopes, see [accessReviewScope](accessreviewscope.md). | 
| settings  |[accessReviewScheduleSettings](../resources/accessreviewschedulesettings.md)| The settings for an access review series, see type definition below. |

These fallback reviewers will be notified to take action if no users are found from the list of reviewers specified. This could occur when either the group owner is specified as the reviewer but the group owner does not exist, or manager is specified as reviewer but a user's manager does not exist. See [accessReviewReviewerScope](accessreviewreviewerscope.md). |
| instances |Collection(microsoft.graph.accessReviewInstance)|  Set of access reviews instances for this access review series. Access reviews that do not recur will only have one instance; otherwise, there will be an instance for each recurrence. |

## Relationships

| Relationship | Type	|Description|

| `instances`               |[accessReviewInstance](accessreviewinstance.md) collection         | If the `accessReviewScheduleDefinition` is a recurring access review, instances represent each recurrence.

If a review has multiple resources and multiple instances, each resource will have a unique instance for each recurrence. |
