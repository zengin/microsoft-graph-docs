# unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

A unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple is used to grant access to resources. It represents a role definition assigned to an array of principals (typically a user) over an array of scope. An example of such an RBAC provider is Microsoft Intune. In Microsoft Intune, you can create a role assignment with multiple principals and multiple scopes.

Providing either **directoryScopeIds** or **appScopeIds** is required.

## Methods

| Method       | Return Type | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------|
| [Get unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple](../api/unifiedroleassignmentmultiple-get.md) | [unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple](unifiedroleassignmentmultiple.md) | Read properties and relationships of unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple object. |
| [Create unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple](../api/unifiedroleassignmentmultiple-post.md) | [unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple](unifiedroleassignmentmultiple.md) | Create a new unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple by posting to the roleAssignment collection. |
| [Update unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple](../api/unifiedroleassignmentmultiple-update.md) | [unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple](unifiedroleassignmentmultiple.md) | Update an existing unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple object. |
| [Delete unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple](../api/unifiedroleassignmentmultiple-delete.md) | None | Delete unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple object. |

## Properties

| Property     | Type        | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------|
| id | String | The unique identifier for the unifiedRoleAssignmentMultiple. Key, not nullable, Read-only. |
| displayName | String | Name of the role assignment. Required. |
| description | String | Description of the role assignment. |
| roleDefinitionId | String | ID of the unifiedRoleDefinition the assignment is for. |
| roleDefinition | [unifiedRoleDefinition](unifiedroledefinition.md) |Property indicating the roleDefinition the assignment is for. Provided so that callers can get the role definition using `$expand` at the same time as getting the role assignment. Read-only.  |
| principalIds | String collection | Objectids of the principals to which the assignment is granted. |
| principals| [directoryObject](directoryobject.md) collection | Read-only collection referencing the assigned principals. Provided so that callers can get the principals using `$expand` at the same time as getting the role assignment. Read-only. |
| directoryScopeIds | String collection | Ids of the directory objects representing the scopes of the assignment. The scopes of an assignment determine the set of resources for which the principals have been granted access. Directory scopes are shared scopes stored in the directory that are understood by multiple applications. App scopes are scopes that are defined and understood by this application only. |
| directoryScopes | [directoryObject](directoryobject.md) collection | Read-only collection referencing the directory objects that are scope of the assignment. Provided so that callers can get the directory objects using `$expand` at the same time as getting the role assignment. Read-only. |
| appScopeIds | String collection | Ids of the app specific scopes when the assignment scopes are app specific. The scopes of an assignment determines the set of resources for which the principal has been granted access. Directory scopes are shared scopes stored in the directory that are understood by multiple applications. Use "/" for tenant-wide scope. App scopes are scopes that are defined and understood by this application only. |
| appScopes | [appScope](appscope.md) collection |Read-only collection with details of the app specific scopes when the assignment scopes are app specific. Containment entity. Read-only.  |
