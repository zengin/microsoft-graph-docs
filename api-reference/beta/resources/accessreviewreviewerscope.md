# accessReviewReviewerScope resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE [accessreviews-disclaimer-v2](../../includes/accessreviews-disclaimer-v2.md)]

The accessReviewReviewerScope defines who will review instances of an [accessReviewScheduleDefinition](accessreviewscheduledefinition.md). This is expressed as an OData query, which allows reviewers to be specified both as a static list of users (i.e., specific users, group owners, group members) or dynamically (i.e., the case where every user is reviewed by their manager). To create a self-review (where users review their own access), do not provide reviewers on [accessReviewScheduleDefinition](accessreviewscheduledefinition.md) creation.


## Properties
| Property | Type | Description |
| :-------------------------| :---------- | :---------- |
| query | String | The query specifying who will be the reviewer. See table for examples. |
| queryType | String | The type of query. Examples include `MicrosoftGraph` and `ARM`. |
| queryRoot | String | In the scenario where reviewers need to be specified dynamically, this property is used to indicate the relative source of the query. This property is only required if a relative query (i.e., ./manager) is specified. |
