# accessReviewInstance resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE [accessreviews-disclaimer-v2](../../includes/accessreviews-disclaimer-v2.md)]

Represents an Azure AD [access review](accessreviewsv2-root.md) recurrence. If the parent [accessReviewScheduleDefinition](accessreviewscheduledefinition.md) is a recurring access review, instances represent each recurrence. A review that does not recur will have exactly one instance. Instances also represent each unique group being reviewed in the schedule definition. If a schedule definition reviews multiple groups, each group will have a unique instance for each recurrence.

Every **accessReviewInstance** contains a list of [decisions](accessreviewinstancedecisionitem.md) that reviewers can take action on. There is one decision per identity being reviewed.
