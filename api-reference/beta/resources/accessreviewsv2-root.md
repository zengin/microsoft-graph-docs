# Azure AD access reviews for groups

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE [accessreviews-disclaimer-v2](../../includes/accessreviews-disclaimer-v2.md)]


You can use [Azure AD access reviews](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-azure-ad-controls-access-reviews-overview) to configure one-time or recurring access reviews for attestation of user's access rights.

Typical customer scenarios for access reviews of group memberships and application access are:

- Customers can review and certify guest user access by using access reviews of their access to applications and memberships of groups. Reviewers can use the insights that are provided to efficiently decide whether guests should have continued access.

- Customers can review and certify employee access to applications and group memberships with access reviews.

- Customers can collect access review controls into programs that are relevant for your organization to track reviews for compliance or risk-sensitive applications.

There is also a related capability for customers to review and certify the role assignments of administrative users who are assigned to Azure AD roles such as Global Administrator or Azure subscription roles.  This capability is included in [Azure AD Privileged Identity Management](privilegedidentitymanagement-root.md).

Note that the access reviews feature, including the API, is included in Azure AD Premium P2.  The tenant where an access review is being created must have a valid purchased or trial Azure AD Premium P2 or EMS E5 subscription.

|[List accessReviewInstanceDecisionItems](../api/accessreviewinstancedecisionitem-list.md) | [accessReviewInstanceDecisionItem](accessreviewinstancedecisionitem.md) collection | Lists every `accessReviewInstanceDecisionItem` for a specific `accessReviewInstance`. |
|[List accessReviewInstanceDecisionItems pending approval](../api/accessreviewinstancedecisionitem-listpendingapproval.md) | [accessReviewInstanceDecisionItem](accessreviewinstancedecisionitem.md) collection. | Get all `accessReviewInstanceDecisionItems` assigned to the calling user, for a specific `accessReviewInstance`. |
|[Update accessReviewInstanceDecisionItem](../api/accessreviewinstancedecisionitem-update.md) | None. | For any `accessReviewInstanceDecisionItems` that the calling user is assigned a reviewer on, calling user can record a decision by patching the decision object. |

## Role and application permission authorization checks

The following directory roles are required for a calling user to manage access reviews. Note that only access reviews on groups are supported currently through Microsoft Graph APIs.

| Operation | Application permissions | Required directory role of the calling user |
|:------------------|:------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Read | AccessReview.Read.All or AccessReview.ReadWrite.All | Global Administrator, Global Reader, Security Administrator, Security Reader or User Administrator |
| Create, Update or Delete | AccessReview.ReadWrite.All | Global Administrator or User Administrator |

In addition, a user who is an assigned reviewer of an access review can manage their decisions, without needing to be in a directory role.
