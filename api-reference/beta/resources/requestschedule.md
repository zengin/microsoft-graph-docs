# requestSchedule resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

In [Azure AD entitlement management](entitlementmanagement-root.md), an access package assignment request is created by a user who wants to obtain an access package assignment. This request can include a schedule for when the user would like to have an assignment.  An access package assignment that results from such a request also has a schedule.

## Properties
