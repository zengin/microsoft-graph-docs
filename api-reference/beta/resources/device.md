# device resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents a device registered in the directory. Devices are created in the cloud using the Device Registration Service or by Intune. They're used by conditional access policies for multi-factor authentication. These devices can range from desktop and laptop machines to phones and tablets. Inherits from [directoryObject](directoryobject.md).

This resource lets you add your own data to custom properties using [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview).
