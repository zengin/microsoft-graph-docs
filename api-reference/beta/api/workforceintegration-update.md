## Request body

In the request body, supply the values for relevant fields that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance, don't include existing values that haven't changed.

| Property     | Type        | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------|
|apiVersion|Int32|API version for the call back url. Start with 1.|
|displayName|String|Name of the workforce integration.|
|encryption|workforceIntegrationEncryption|The workforce integration encryption resource. |
|isActive|Boolean|Indicates whether this workforce integration is currently active and available.|
|supports|string| Possible values are `none`, `shift`, `swapRequest`, `openshift`, `openShiftRequest`, `userShiftPreferences`. If selecting more than one value, all values must start with the first letter in uppercase.|
|supportedEntities|string| This property will replace **supports** in v1.0. We recommend that you use this property instead of **supports**.

If selecting more than one value, all values must start with the first letter in uppercase.|
|url|String| Workforce Integration url for callbacks from the Shift service. |
