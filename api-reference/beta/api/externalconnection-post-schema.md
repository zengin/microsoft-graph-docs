# Create schema

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create the schema for a Microsoft Search [connection](../resources/externalconnection.md).

[!INCLUDE [search-api-preview](../../includes/search-api-preview-signup.md)]

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | Not supported. |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | ExternalItem.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /external/connections/{id}/schema
```

## Request headers

| Name                  | Description                                                        |
|:----------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Authorization         | Bearer {token}. Required.                                          |
| Content-Type          | application/json. Required.                                        |
| Prefer: respond-async | Use this to cause the request to execute asynchronously. Optional. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of a [schema](../resources/schema.md) object.

When registering a custom item schema, the `schema` object MUST have the `baseType` property set to `microsoft.graph.externalItem` and MUST contain the `properties` property. The `properties` object must contain at least one property, up to a maximum of 64.

## Response

With the `Prefer: respond-async` header included in the request, if successful, this method returns a `202 Accepted` response code and a URL in the `Location` response header that can be used to [get the operation status](../api/connectionoperation-get.md).

Without the `Prefer: respond-async` header included in the request, if successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a new [schema](../resources/schema.md) object in the response body.

> [!NOTE]
> Creating a schema is a long-running process prone to gateway timeouts. We recommend using the `Prefer: respond-async` header to avoid timeout errors.

## Examples

### Example: Register custom schema asynchronously
