# passwordAuthenticationMethod: resetPassword

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Initiate a reset for the password associated with a [password authentication method](../resources/passwordauthenticationmethod.md) object. This can only be done by an administrator with appropriate permissions and cannot be performed on a user's own account.

This flow writes the new password to Azure Active Directory and pushes it to on-premises Active Directory if configured using password writeback. The admin can either provide a new password or have the system generate one. The user is prompted to change their password on their next sign in.

This reset is a long-running operation and will return a link in the `Location` header where the caller can periodically check for the status of the reset.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions acting on self (from least to most privileged) | Permissions acting on others (from least to most privileged)|
|:---------------------------------------|:-------------------------|:-----------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | Not supported. | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application                            | Not supported. | Not supported. |

For delegated scenarios where an admin is acting on another user, the admin needs [one of the following roles](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#available-roles):

* Global admin
* Privileged authentication admin
* Authentication admin

|newPassword|String|The new password entered by the admin. Required for tenants with hybrid password scenarios. If omitted for a cloud-only password, the system returns a system-generated password. This is a unicode string with no other encoding. It is validated against the tenant's banned password system before acceptance, and must adhere to the tenant's cloud and/or on-premises password requirements.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `202 ACCEPTED` response code and a URL in the `Location` header.

If the caller did not submit a password, a Microsoft-generated password is provided in a JSON object in the response body.
