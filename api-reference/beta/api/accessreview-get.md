# Get accessReview

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

In the Azure AD [access reviews](../resources/accessreviews-root.md) feature, retrieve an [accessReview](../resources/accessreview.md) object.  

To retrieve the reviewers of the access review, use the [list accessReview reviewers](accessreview-listreviewers.md) API. To retrieve the decisions of the access review, use the [list accessReview decisions](accessreview-listdecisions.md) API, or the [list my accessReview decisions](accessreview-listmydecisions.md) API.

If this is a recurring access review, no decisions will be associated with the recurring access review series. Instead, use the `instances` relationship of that series to retrieve an [accessReview](../resources/accessreview.md) collection of the past, current, and future instances of the access review. Each past and current instance will have decisions.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).
