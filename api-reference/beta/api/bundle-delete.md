# Delete bundle

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Delete a [bundle][] of driveItems by using its **id**.
Note that deleting a bundle using this method permanently deletes the bundle and does not move it to the Recycle Bin.
It does not, however, remove the items that were referenced by the bundle.
They will remain in their parent folders.
