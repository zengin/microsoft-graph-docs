# Send chatMessage in a chat

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a new [chatMessage](../resources/chatmessage.md) in the specified [chat](../resources/chat.md). This API cannot create a new chat; you must use the [list chats](chat-list.md) method to retrieve the ID of an existing chat before creating a chat message.

> **Note**: We don't recommend that you use this API for data migration. It does not have the throughput necessary for a typical migration.

> **Note**: It is a violation of the [terms of use](/legal/microsoft-apis/terms-of-use) to use Microsoft Teams as a log file. Only send messages that people will read.

## Permissions
