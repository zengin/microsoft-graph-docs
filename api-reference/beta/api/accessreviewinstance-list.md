# List accessReviewInstance

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve the [accessReviewInstance](../resources/accessreviewinstance.md) objects for a specific [accessReviewScheduleDefinition](../resources/accessreviewscheduledefinition.md). A list of zero or more **accessReviewInstance** objects are returned, including all of their nested properties. Returned objects do not include associated accessReviewInstanceDecisionItems. To retrieve the decisions on the instance, use [List accessReviewInstanceDecisionItem](accessreviewinstancedecisionitem-list.md).

>[!NOTE]
>If many **accessReviewInstances** are returned, to improve efficiency and avoid timeouts, retrieve the result set in pages, by including both the $top query parameter with a page size of at most 100, and the $skip=0 query parameter in the request. When a result set spans multiple pages, Microsoft Graph returns that page with an @odata.nextLink property in the response that contains a URL to the next page of results. If that property is present, continue making additional requests with the @odata.nextLink URL in each response, until all the results are returned, as described in paging Microsoft Graph data in your app.
>
>If no query parameters are provided and there are more than 100 results, Microsoft Graph will automatically paginate results at 100 results per page.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account)     | AccessReview.Read.All, AccessReview.ReadWrite.All  |
|Application                            | AccessReview.Read.All, AccessReview.ReadWrite.All |

The signed-in user must also be in a directory role that permits them to read an access review. To view just the instances that the signed-in user is assigned the reviewer on, see [List pending access review instances](accessreviewinstance-pendingaccessreviewinstances.md)
