## Examples

### Example 1: Setting **bannerLogo** for the fr localization using PUT

The following request updates the banner logo for the fr localization. Using PUT, if the fr localization does not exist, "404 not found" is returned. If the payload contains an id property or Content-Language header, and they don't match id in URL, a Bad Request is returned.

#### Request

The following is an example of the request.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "update_organizationalbrandingproperties"
}-->

```http
PUT https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/organization/d69179bf-f4a4-41a9-a9de-249c0f2efb1d/branding/localizations/fr/bannerLogo
Content-Type: image/jpeg

#### Response

The following is an example of the response.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": true,
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.organizationalBrandingProperties"
} -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 204 NO CONTENT
```

### Example 2: Update **bannerLogo** for the fr localization using PATCH

The following request updates the banner logo for the fr localization.  Using PATCH, if the specified localization does not already exist, it is created and the property is written to it.

#### Request

The following is an example of the request.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "update_organizationalbrandingproperties"
}-->

```http
PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/organization/d69179bf-f4a4-41a9-a9de-249c0f2efb1d/branding/localizations/fr
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "backgroundColor":"#00000F",
    "signInPageText": "fr"
}
```

#### Response
The following is an example of the response.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": true,
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.organizationalBrandingProperties"
} -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```



### Example 3: Override default branding value with a blank string

If the value of a property in a localization is null, the value will be inherited from the default branding. To prevent this from happening, set an empty string or string containing only whitespace in the localized branding.

#### Request

The following is an example of the request.
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "update_organizationalbrandingproperties"
}-->

```http
PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/organization/d69179bf-f4a4-41a9-a9de-249c0f2efb1d/branding/localizations/fr
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "signInPageText": "French sign-in text.",
    "usernameHintText":" "
}
```

#### Response

The following is an example of the response.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": true,
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.organizationalBrandingProperties"
} -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

Following this request, usernameHintText for the fr localization will be empty instead of inheriting the value from default branding.

### Example 4: Replace French localization with PUT

To make an update on localization using PUT, we should add all properties in body along with the property that needs to be updated as PUT replaces existing object with the new one. The other properties which are not in the payload body of PUT will be set to NULL. Here in example below, only backgroundColor property is retained and signInPageText is updated while others are set to null.
If the specified localization does not already exist, PUT to the URL specifying that localization creates it.
If the payload contains an id property or a Content-Language header, and they don't match id in URL, we throw Bad request.

# [HTTP](#tab/http)

  "blockType": "request",

```http
