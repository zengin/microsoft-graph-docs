[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Set a user's [emailAuthenticationMethod](../resources/emailauthenticationmethod.md) object. Email authentication is a self-service password reset method. A user may only have one email authentication method.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type|Permissions acting on self (from least to most privileged)|Permissions acting on others (from least to most privileged)|
|:---|:---|:--|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application                            | Not applicable. | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All |

* Global admin
* Privileged authentication admin
* Authentication admin
