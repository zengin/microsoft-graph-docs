## HTTP request

```http
POST /administrativeUnits

```
## Request headers
| Name      |Description|

| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Content-type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of an [administrativeUnit](../resources/administrativeunit.md) object.

Because the **administrativeUnit** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can use the `POST` operation and add custom properties with your own data to the administrative unit while creating it.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [administrativeUnit](../resources/administrativeunit.md) object in the response body.
