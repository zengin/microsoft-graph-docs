# List phoneMethods

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve a list of [phone authentication method](../resources/phoneauthenticationmethod.md) objects. This will return up to three objects, as a user can have up to three phones usable for authentication.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions acting on self (from least to most privileged) | Permissions acting on others (from least to most privileged)|
|:---------------------------------------|:-------------------------|:-----------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | UserAuthenticationMethod.Read, UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite | UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All, UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application                            | Not applicable. | UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All, UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All |

For delegated scenarios where an admin is acting on another user, the admin needs [one of the following roles](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#available-roles):

* Global admin
* Global reader
* Privileged authentication admin
* Authentication admin (only sees masked phone numbers)
