# Get directory objects from a list of ids

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Return the directory objects specified in a list of IDs.

Some common uses for this function are to:

* Resolve IDs returned by functions (that return collections of IDs) such as [getMemberObjects](./directoryobject-getmemberobjects.md) or [getMemberGroups](./directoryobject-getmembergroups.md)  to their backing directory objects.
* Resolve IDs persisted in an external store by the application to their backing directory objects.
