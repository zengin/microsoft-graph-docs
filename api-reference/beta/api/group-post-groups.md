# Create group

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a new [group](../resources/group.md) as specified in the request body. You can create one of the following groups:

* Microsoft 365 group (unified group)
* Security group

This operation returns by default only a subset of the properties for each group. These default properties are noted in the [Properties](../resources/group.md#properties) section. To get properties that are _not_ returned by default, do a [GET operation](group-get.md) and specify the properties in a `$select` OData query option.

>**Note**: To create a [team](../resources/team.md), first create a group then add a team to it, see [create team](../api/team-put-teams.md).

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All, Directory.AccessAsUser.All  |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Group.Create, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /groups
```

## Request headers

| Name       | Type | Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| Authorization  | string  | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body

The following table shows the properties of the [group](../resources/group.md) resource to specify when you create a group. 

| Property | Type | Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| displayName | string | The name to display in the address book for the group. Required. |
| description | string | A description for the group. Optional. |
| isAssignableToRole | Boolean | Set to **true** to enable the group to be assigned to an Azure AD role. Only Privileged Role Administrator and Global Administrator can set the value of this property. Optional. |
| mailEnabled | boolean | Set to **true** for mail-enabled groups. Required. |
| mailNickname | string | The mail alias for the group. These characters cannot be used in the mailNickName: `@()\[]";:.<>,SPACE`. Required. |
| securityEnabled | boolean | Set to **true** for security-enabled groups, including Microsoft 365 groups. Required. |
| owners | [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) collection | This property represents the owners for the group at creation time. Optional. |
| members | [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) collection | This property represents the members for the group at creation time. Optional. |
|visibility|String|Specifies the visibility of a Microsoft 365 group. Possible values are: `Private`, `Public`, `HiddenMembership`, or empty (which is interpreted as `Public`).|

> **Note:** Groups created using the Microsoft Azure portal always have **securityEnabled** initially set to `true`.

Because the **group** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can use the `POST` operation and add custom properties with your own data to the group while creating it.

>**Note:** Creating a group using the Group.Create application permission without specifying owners will create the group anonymously and the group will not be modifiable. You can use the `POST` operation and add owners to the group while creating it to specify owners who can modify the group.

> Creating a Microsoft 365 group programmatically with an app-only context and without specifying owners will create the group anonymously. Doing so can result in the associated SharePoint Online site not being created automatically until further manual action is taken.  

Specify other writable properties as necessary for your group. For more information, see the properties of the [group](../resources/group.md) resource.

### groupTypes options

Use the **groupTypes** property to control the type of group and its membership, as shown.

| Type of group | Assigned membership | Dynamic membership |
|:--------------|:------------------------|:---------------|
| Microsoft 365 (aka unified group)| `["Unified"]` | `["Unified","DynamicMembership"]`
| Dynamic | `[]` (_null_) | `["DynamicMembership"]`|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a [group](../resources/group.md) object in the response body. The response includes only the default properties of the group.

### Example 2: Create a security group with an owner and members

The following example creates a security group with an owner and members specified. Note that a maximum of 20 relationships, such as owners and members, can be added as part of group creation. You can subsequently add more members by using the [add member](/graph/api/group-post-members?view=graph-rest-beta&tabs=http) API or JSON batching.

A group with **isAssignableToRole** property set to `true` cannot be of dynamic membership type.
