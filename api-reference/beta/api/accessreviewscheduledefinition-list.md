# List accessReviewScheduleDefinition

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve the [accessReviewScheduleDefinition](../resources/accessreviewscheduledefinition.md) objects. A list of zero or more accessReviewScheduleDefinition objects are returned, including all of their nested properties, for each access review series created. This does not include associated accessReviewInstances.

>[!NOTE]
>If many **accessReviewScheduleDefinitions** are returned, to improve efficiency and avoid timeouts, retrieve the result set in pages, by including both the $top query parameter with a page size of at most 100, and the $skip=0 query parameter in the request. When a result set spans multiple pages, Microsoft Graph returns that page with an @odata.nextLink property in the response that contains a URL to the next page of results. If that property is present, continue making additional requests with the @odata.nextLink URL in each response, until all the results are returned, as described in paging Microsoft Graph data in your app.
>
>If no query parameters are provided and there are more than 100 results, Microsoft Graph will automatically paginate results at 100 results per page.
