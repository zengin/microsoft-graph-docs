# List outcomes

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve a list of [educationOutcome](../resources/educationoutcome.md) objects.  There are three types of outcomes: **educationPointsOutcome**, **educationFeedbackOutcome**, and **educationRubricOutcome**.

A submission for a credit assignment (one that has no point value and no rubric) will have an [educationFeedbackOutcome](../resources/educationpointsoutcome.md). (It might also return an [educationPointsOutcome](../resources/educationpointsoutcome.md), but that outcome is ignored.)

A submission for a points assignment (one that has a point value assigned) will have both an [educationFeedbackOutcome](../resources/educationpointsoutcome.md) and an [educationPointsOutcome](../resources/educationpointsoutcome.md).

A submission for an assignment with an attached rubric, if the rubric is a credit rubric (no points), will have an [educationFeedbackOutcome](../resources/educationpointsoutcome.md) and an [educationRubricOutcome](../resources/educationrubricoutcome.md). (It might also return an [educationPointsOutcome](../resources/educationpointsoutcome.md), but that outcome is ignored.)

A submission for an assignment with an attached rubric, if the rubric is a points rubric, will have an [educationFeedbackOutcome](../resources/educationpointsoutcome.md), an [educationPointsOutcome](../resources/educationpointsoutcome.md, and an [educationRubricOutcome](../resources/educationrubricoutcome.md).

All outcome types have a regular and a published property appropriate to that type of outcome; for example, **points** and **publishedPoints**, **feedback** and **publishedFeedback**.  The regular property is the most recent value updated by the teacher; the published property is the most recent value returned to the student.
