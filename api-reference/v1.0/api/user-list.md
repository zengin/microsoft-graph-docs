# List users

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve a list of [user](../resources/user.md) objects.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | User.ReadBasic.All, User.Read.All, User.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All, Directory.AccessAsUser.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | User.Read.All, User.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /users
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response, including `$search`, `$count`, `$filter`, and `$select`. You can use `$search` on the **displayName** property. When items are added or updated for this resource, they are specially indexed for use with the `$count` and `$search` query parameters. There can be a slight delay between when an item is added or updated and when it is available in the index. The `$count` and `$search` parameters are currently not available in Azure AD B2C tenants.

By default, only a limited set of properties are returned (**businessPhones**, **displayName**, **givenName**, **id**, **jobTitle**, **mail**, **mobilePhone**, **officeLocation**, **preferredLanguage**, **surname**, and **userPrincipalName**). 

To return an alternative property set, specify the desired set of [user](../resources/user.md) properties using the OData `$select` query parameter. For example, to return **displayName**, **givenName**, and **postalCode**, add the following to your query `$select=displayName,givenName,postalCode`.

Certain properties cannot be returned within a user collection. The following properties are only supported when [retrieving an single user](./user-get.md): **aboutMe**, **birthday**, **hireDate**, **interests**, **mySite**, **pastProjects**, **preferredName**, **responsibilities**, **schools**, **skills**, **mailboxSettings**.

## Request headers

| Header        | Value                      |
|:--------------|:---------------------------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token} (required)  |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using `$search`, or when using `$filter` with the `$orderby` query parameter. It uses an index that may not be up-to-date with recent changes to the object. |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [user](../resources/user.md) objects in the response body. If a large user collection is returned, you can use [paging in your app](/graph/paging).
