> [!NOTE]
> When calling this API using tokens issued for a personal Microsoft account, it will return the apps owned by the personal Microsoft account. The notion of organizations doesn't exist for personal Microsoft accounts. In order to list applications owned by specific personal Microsoft accounts, this API requires User.Read permission in addition to Application.Read.All or Application.ReadWrite.All.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).


|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Application.Read.All, Application.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.AccessAsUser.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Application.Read.All and User.Read, Application.ReadWrite.All and User.Read |
|Application | Application.Read.All, Application.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /applications
```
## Optional query parameters

This method supports the [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response, including `$search`, `$count`, and `$filter`. You can use `$search` on the **displayName** and **description** properties. When items are added or updated for this resource, they are specially indexed for use with the `$count` and `$search` query parameters. There can be a slight delay between when an item is added or updated and when it is available in the index.

## Request headers

| Name           | Description                |
|:---------------|:---------------------------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using `$search`, or when using `$filter` with the `$orderby` query parameter. It uses an index that may not be up-to-date with recent changes to the object. |

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.
