# Delete a delegated permission grant (oAuth2PermissionGrant)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Delete an [oAuth2PermissionGrant](../resources/oauth2permissiongrant.md).

When a delegated permission grant is deleted, the access it granted is revoked. Existing access tokens will continue to be valid for their lifetime, but new access tokens will not be granted for the delegated permissions identified in the deleted **oAuth2PermissionGrant**.

> [!NOTE]
> There may be two delegated permission grants authorizing an application to act on behalf of a user when calling an API. This can happen when a user consents for the application on their own behalf (creating an **oAuth2PermissionGrant** with **consentType** *Principal*, identifying the user) and then an administrator grants tenant-wide admin consent on behalf of all users (creating a second **oAuth2PermissionGrant** with **consentType** of *AllPrincipals*).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
