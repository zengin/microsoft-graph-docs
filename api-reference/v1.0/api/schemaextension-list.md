# List schemaExtensions

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get a list of [schemaExtension](../resources/schemaextension.md) objects created by any apps you own in the current tenant (that can be 
**InDevelopment**, **Available**, or **Deprecated**), and all other schema extensions owned by other apps that are marked as **Available**. 

> **Note:** The list will also contain schema extension definitions (marked as `Available`) created by other developers from other tenants. This is different from other APIs that only return tenant-specific data. Extension data created based on schema extension definitions is tenant-specific and can only be accessed by apps explicitly granted permission. 

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).


|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | User.Read, Application.Read.All  |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Application.Read.All |
