# List owners

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve a list of the group's owners. The owners are a set of users or service principals who are allowed to modify the group object. Owners are currently not available in Microsoft Graph for groups that were created in Exchange or groups that are synchronized from an on-premises environment.

>**Note:** Currently, service principals are not listed as group owners due to the staged rollout of service principals to the Microsoft Graph v1.0 endpoint.
