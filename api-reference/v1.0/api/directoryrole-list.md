# List directoryRoles

Namespace: microsoft.graph

List the directory roles that are activated in the tenant.

This operation only returns roles that have been activated. A role becomes activated when an admin activates the role using the [Activate directoryRole](directoryrole-post-directoryroles.md) API. Not all built-in roles are initially activated. 

When assigning a role using the Azure portal, the role activation step is implicitly done on the admin's behalf. To get the full list of roles that are available in Azure AD, use [List directoryRoleTemplates](directoryroletemplate-list.md).

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | RoleManagement.Read.Directory, Directory.Read.All, RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory, Directory.ReadWrite.All, Directory.AccessAsUser.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | RoleManagement.Read.Directory, Directory.Read.All, RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory, Directory.ReadWrite.All |
