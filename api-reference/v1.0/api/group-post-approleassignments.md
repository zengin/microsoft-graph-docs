# Grant an appRoleAssignment to a group

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Use this API to assign an app role to a group. All direct members of the group will be considered assigned. To grant an app role assignment to a group, you need three identifiers:

- `principalId`: The `id` of the group to which you are assigning the app role.
- `resourceId`: The `id` of the resource `servicePrincipal` which has defined the app role.
- `appRoleId`: The `id` of the `appRole` (defined on the resource service principal) to assign to the group.

Additional licenses might be required to [use a group to manage access to applications](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/groups-saasapps).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All, Directory.AccessAsUser.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /groups/{id}/appRoleAssignments
```

> [!NOTE]
> As a best practice, we recommend creating app role assignments through the `appRoleAssignedTo` relationship of the _resource_ service principal, instead of the `appRoleAssignments` relationship of the assigned user, group, or service principal.

## Request headers

| Name       | Description|
|:-----------|:----------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| Content-type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of an [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) object.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) object in the response body.

In this example, `{id}` and `{principalId-value}` would both be the `id` of the assigned group.
