# Enroll corporate-owned devices by using Intune

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> **Note:** Using the Microsoft Graph APIs to configure Intune controls and policies still requires that the Intune service is [correctly licensed](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/microsoft-intune-pricing) by the customer.

You can enroll organization-owned or corporate-owned devices to manage with Intune in a variety of ways, depending on the type of device, how the device was purchased, and the needs of the organization. You also can install the Company Portal app to enroll and manage corporate-owned devices, like in a "bring your own device" (BYOD) scenario.

The following Graph resources are available to manage corporate-owned devices in Intune:

- [Imported windows autopilot device identity](intune-enrollment-importedwindowsautopilotdeviceidentity.md)
- [Imported windows autopilot device identity import status](intune-enrollment-importedwindowsautopilotdeviceidentityimportstatus.md)
- [Imported windows autopilot device identity state](intune-enrollment-importedwindowsautopilotdeviceidentitystate.md)
- [Imported windows autopilot device identity upload](intune-enrollment-importedwindowsautopilotdeviceidentityupload.md)
- [Imported windows autopilot device identity upload status](intune-enrollment-importedwindowsautopilotdeviceidentityuploadstatus.md)
