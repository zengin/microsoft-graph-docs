# objectIdentity resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Represents an identity used to sign in to a user account. An identity can be provided by Microsoft, by organizations, or by social identity providers such as Facebook, Google, or Microsoft, that are tied to a user account. This enables the user to sign in to the user account with any of those associated identities.

The **identities** property of the [user](user.md) resource is an **objectIdentity** object.

## Properties

| Property   | Type |Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|signInType|string| Specifies the user sign-in types in your directory, such as `emailAddress`, `userName` or `federated`. Here, `federated` represents a unique identifier for a user from an issuer, that can be in any format chosen by the issuer. Additional validation is enforced on **issuerAssignedId** when the sign-in type is set to `emailAddress` or `userName`. This property can also be set to any custom string.|
|issuer|string|Specifies the issuer of the identity, for example `facebook.com`.<br>For local accounts (where **signInType** is not `federated`), this property is the local B2C tenant default domain name, for example `contoso.onmicrosoft.com`.<br>For external users from other Azure AD organization, this will be the domain of the federated organization, for example `contoso.com`.<br><br>Supports `$filter`. 512 character limit.|
|issuerAssignedId|string|Specifies the unique identifier assigned to the user by the issuer. The combination of **issuer** and **issuerAssignedId** must be unique within the organization. Represents the sign-in name for the user, when **signInType** is set to `emailAddress` or `userName` (also known as local accounts).<br>When **signInType** is set to: <ul><li>`emailAddress`, (or starts with `emailAddress` like `emailAddress1`) **issuerAssignedId** must be a valid email address</li><li>`userName`, **issuerAssignedId** must be a valid [local part of an email address](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696#section-3)</li></ul>Supports `$filter`. 512 character limit.|

>**Note:** When filtering on the **identities** property, you must supply both **issuer** and **issuerAssignedId**.
